1. For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?

SRTN has the same turnaround time as FIFO when the jobs are the same burst sizes or if if the jobs are larger one after the other.

2. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response times as RR?

when the quantum is larger than the longest job. 

3. What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?

The longer the job length gets the longer the average job length gets as well. 

Input:
10 5
100 10
200 20
400 30
800 40

Out:
Job   0 -- Turnaround 10.00 Wait 0.00
Job   1 -- Turnaround 105.00 Wait 5.00
Job   2 -- Turnaround 295.00 Wait 95.00
Job   3 -- Turnaround 685.00 Wait 285.00
Job   4 -- Turnaround 1475.00 Wait 675.00
Average -- Turnaround 514.00 Wait 212.00


4. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?

As the quantum length increases the response time increases with it.
